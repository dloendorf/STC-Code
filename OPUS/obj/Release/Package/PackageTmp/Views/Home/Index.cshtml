<h3>LADIES OPUS (Organized Play Using Scoring)</h3>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Open to all ladies who are STC members (A, B+, B, C+, and C) and who wish to participate in a “scoring” system to determine ladder positioning which will result in competitive games for participating players.</li>
    <li>Program will only apply on <span><strong>Monday - Ladies LATE</strong></span> Organized Play Sessions.</li>
    <li>Scoring and ladder position will be CONFIDENTIAL information used only by the OPUS Monitors.</li>
    <li>Your OPUS scoring will in NO way affect your STC Ranking.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Registering as an OPUS Player</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Ladies volunteering to participate in this program should notify the STC Coordinator. </li>
    <li>Players wishing to participate will be coded with an "O" by the STC Coordinators in the Organized Play System. You will then notice an "O" next to your name in the member listing.</li>
    <li>You are encouraged to commit to playing a minimum of 3 OPUS days during the 10 weeks set aside for an OPUS fall, winter, or spring season. You may participate in all OPUS seasons.</li>
    <li>There will be a confidential original seeding process to determine ladder positioning based on your STC ranking. This will be done by the OPUS Monitors.</li>
    <li>A player wishing to withdraw from the OPUS program may do so at anytime by notifying the STC Coordinator to remove the “O” code from her name. The STC Coordinator will then notify the OPUS Monitors of the change in status.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Sign-Ups</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Log into the STC system and sign up as you would for any Organized Play session.</li>
    <li>You may not "link" with another player.</li>
    <li>Sign-Up <span><strong>CLOSES THURSDAY AT MIDNIGHT</strong></span> for the Monday Late OPUS match so that Monitors can assign courts on Thursday.</li>
    <li>You can view your court assignments on Saturday on the STC website for your Monday match.</li>
    <li>All players, both OP and OPUS, will be assigned matches, as usual, by the order in which they sign up with no priority given to one group or the other.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Matches</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Court assignment is based on your OPUS ladder position, the court you played on last week, and the players with whom you played last week.</li>
    <li>STC will post the court assignments as usual. You will play a round robin with each of the ladies on the court, starting with whomever the STC website for OP has you matched. After your first set, spin to determine order of play. You might not finish the 3rd set, but <span><strong>you will still record the scores.</strong></span></li>
    <li>During your play, participants will use no-ad scoring. This hastens the play and betters your opportunity to play with all 3 players.</li>
    <li>In NO-AD scoring, if and when you reach “Deuce”, then you serve just 1 more time. The receiving team selects which person will receive your serve. After that point, the game is over.</li>
    <li>If all players on the court wish to play beyond the 2 hour OP window, and if the court is available, you are welcome to do so, but normally play ends at the 2 hour window.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Score Sheets</h4>
<ul>
    <li><span><strong>One signed OPUS match score sheet per court</strong></span> will be turned in to the OPUS box provided at the Tennis Center no later than end of STC office hours TUESDAY.</li>
    <li>These scores will be used to re-calculate your position in the ladder and help to determine your next match play. Each week this process will be repeated.</li>
    <li>These scores will NOT be counted toward your Provisional status totals or averages if you are registered as a Provisional (P) player. However, any Provisional player may participate in OPUS.</li>
    <li>If court pairings result in OPUS participants playing with non-OPUS participants due to late sign-up times, uneven player number sign-ups, unexpected scratches or alternate sign-ups, these scores can be counted toward your OPUS totals or averages. The non-OPUS participant's name and scores will NOT be recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rankings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Your OPUS ladder position is calculated using a computerized mathematical formula including, but not limited to, your STC ranking, your previous week’s percent of games won and your overall percent of games won.</li>
    <li>Scores, rankings and ladder positioning are used in determining your next match and are <span><strong>CONFIDENTIAL</strong></span>. Only the STC OPUS Monitors setting the match utilize or see these scores.</li>
    <li>Again, ladder positioning is confidential and is not posted or shared with any other players.</li>
    <li>Your OPUS scoring will in NO way affect your STC ranking.</li>
</ul>
